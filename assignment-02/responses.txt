The World Wide Web is different from the Internet. This is mainly due to the web being a service on the internet. The internet is a network of connected computers, while the web is what you see while your online (like pages).
The internet is a network of computers that communicate together. Therefore, the internet works by connecting computers wirelessly or physically (with ethernet cables). Although, the internet is so big that we use routers to direct computer communication, and you can connect routers to routers to get an even bigger network. Then modems come into play by connecting our network information into information manageable by telephone infrastructer. Then to connect networks to networks, we use an internet service provider, who have special routers that link together. Therefore, the internet is made up of many networks all connected.
