1. What was old from HTML was the 4 main elements and the 4 meta datas. What is new in HTML is styling the webpage, which is actually pretty simple to do.
What is interesting to do is styling because it offers more creativity. What is difficult to learn is making sure that I have everything correct and that I have the proper tags in place so that it doesn't appear messed up on my webpage.
2. I am excited to learn CSS because I love mixing up colors, backgrounds and styles to make the webpage unique.
3. Overall, this section was mainly just review. I did have some difficulty remembering everything we had learned, but using the site website and referring to my old homework helped me overcome those challenges. Some of the easier parts of this homework was headings and paragraph tags.
