   <p>I chose this project because I have always loved playing Hangman. In elementary school, My teachers use to play Hangman to study. The word would be a vocabulary word and they would give us a hint. It was a great way to learn and if you are interested, you can find more information <a href="https://www.hangmanwords.com/how-to">here.</a></p>
