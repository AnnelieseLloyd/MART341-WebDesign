1. My imaginary client is a greek themed restaurant. This client described their site needs as something simply, with a blue and white color scheme to match the restaurant. They also descibed that they needed a service page, a home page, a contact page, and a about page. They wanted a site navigation that also included 3 outside links to similar restaurants in the area.
2. It is important to design a mobile friendly website because a lot of people around the world use the internet from their phone. Due to a lot of people using their phone to access the internet and websites, you need to make sure that your website is accessible and usable for them. That is why every website should be mobile friendly. 
3. My challenges this week was added a drop-down nagivation, which was complicated due to the hover. But I used our course website for help and I was able to figure it out- kinda. It is not going up in the navigation bar like I want it to.
