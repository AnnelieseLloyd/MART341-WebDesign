This week, I learned about directories, and proper file naming systems. I also created a new repository and a few new files. I then edited those files and learned how to upload a screenshot to one of my files. Some challenges I came across was navigating the repository and uploading the screenshot. Some of the easier tasks this week was editing and creating files.
