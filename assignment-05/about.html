  <h1>Robert Munsch</h1>
<pre>Robert Munsch was born in Pittsberg, Pennsylvania in 1945. Similar to me, he grew up in a big family of 9 kids.
He studied to be a Jesuit priest, but after some self-discovery he found out being a priest was not for him. He has a undergraduate in History, and a Master's degree in Anthropology.
After he left the Jesuits, he worked for a daycare. This is where he learned that he "could get the kids to shut up during nap time by telling them stories" (RobertMuncsch.com).
After 10 years, his wife convinced him to publish a child story and from then on out he become a well-known writer.</pre>
