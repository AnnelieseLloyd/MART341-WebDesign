Did you learn anything new about web development?
1. Yes, throughout this entire semester I learned a lot about web development. One of the biggest things I learned was the need for a text editor. It helps me write and read code and helps keep documentation. Another thing I learned about web development is using Github, which has been super easy to navigate and upload projects, as well as have a solid URl link to my websites. I did know about repositories, but it was nice to be refreshed about the idea. Overall, I learned a valuable skill that I am very happy to have. 



Did you learn anything new about web design?
2. Yes, I also learned a lot about web design. I learned that not only can you self-host fonts, but also that you can assign different headers and paragraphs all different fonts, but to also maintain consistancy throughout the website. I also learned about color theory, and making sure words are legible. 


Free Response: Discuss any challenges you had and what you did to overcome them.
3. There were not a lot of common problems I have had throughout the semester. Besides asking questions to the teacher, I would use Google to find answers. Which is a very nice perk to using HTML because it is so easy to find resources. While using Google, I did find many people using JAVA to build websites, which I think would be really interesting to learn. For this assignment specifically, I learned how to create pretty navigation bars, as well as social media dropdown menu.
