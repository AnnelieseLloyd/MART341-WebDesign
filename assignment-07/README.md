The forms I have come across while browsing the web are text forms, password forms, username forms, reset/submit forms. The purpose of these forms is to allow users to
enter data and then to send that data to a server.


Some examples are text input, which allow users to freely enter text. Another example is radio buttons, which allow users to select the category they choose, which is useful to collect data.


Some of the successes I have had during this week is adding the address, phone and email. Some of the challenges was adding the table, styling and adding the forms. I overcame these challenges by using Uncle Google and referring back to the course website and my notes.
