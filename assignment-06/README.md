1. A page will only render one main element. Therefore, when writing html, you can only have one <head> and <body> element.
The <head> and <body> element are different because the <head> element is a container for processing information and document metadata. It includes high-level information on the site, such as the title.
The <body> element is rendered by the browser and displays the data on the user's computer. Essentially, the <body> element contains anything you want users to see.
2. The Difference between structure and semantic markup is that structural markup structures the page layout, like sidebar or navigation bar. Meanwhile, Semantic markup provides additional information, like adding emphasis to a sentence.
3. Overall, this week seemed pretty straight forward. Some of my successes were added an image and headings. Some of my challenges are remembering the 4 main elements of html. I overcame this challenge my creating a word document were I can have the 4 main elements for reference.
