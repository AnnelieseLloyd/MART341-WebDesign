   <h1>Lost My Mind Lyrics</h1>
   <pre> I'm always stressing in the good times and fine when there's a tragedy
Better under pressure or when everybody's mad at me
Anxious on a Friday when I should be feeling happily
Fighting over bullshit while I'm looking at a masterpiece, yo
Feel like our clothes, bro, we never taking 'em off
Maybe we too close, you never tell me about
All the things you think, we used to do that a lot
I know time will help whether we make it or not
Monday morning hit my line, not you, not important
We used to kick it but that's feeling foreign
Missed times, up late, put it down, we record it
Watched back on the big screen, eat pop corn while we enjoy it, yeah
We were nasty, don't @ me
Hard for me to see you happy, hurtin' badly
And I see you with that other dude, how long 'til you change your mood?
You always wanted something new, you always wanted something new (Hey hey hey)


Feeling like I lost mind (Yeah)
Everytime you cross my mind (Hey hey hey)
Feeling like I lost mind
Everytime you cross my mind (Hey hey hey)


Sometimes I think, sometimes I think, this
Sometimes I think, sometimes I think, this
Sometimes I don't think, sometimes I don't stop
My brain been narrating, been thinking a whole lot, yeah
Hard to sleep without you next to me
I listen to slow songs, that shit help me dose off, yeah
I don't look again, this the only game
Send a postcard, I'm at 1 Lonely Lane
But don't let him see you do it
yeah I know he's looking not my thing to ruin, even though I know you'd do the same (Hey hey hey)
Yeah, that's what we said when we were younger
If one found another we would fuck it up and then recover (Hey hey hey)
Yeah, we on some lowkey lover shit
Hear you want some subtle shit
I just wanna why, you cut me off too?
After all the things that I told you
Now I'm going insane, everytime I cross (Hey hey hey)



Feeling like I lost mind (Yeah)
Everytime you cross my mind (Hey hey hey)
Feeling like I lost mind
Everytime you cross my mind

Feeling like I lost mind
Everytime you cross my mind (Hey hey hey)
Feeling like I lost mind
Everytime you cross my mind


In the past few months, I only work instead of go out
Been tryna get me to go out more but I do not how, to slow down
It would be nice to spend the night and go to where you at
Without coming back, that's a one way flight (Damn)
Kill the lights like we both feeling murderous
We don't feel the same, it's a shame, shit hurtin' us
Kill the lights like we both feeling murderous
We don't feel the same, it's a shame, shit hurtin' us


Feeling like I lost mind (Yeah)
Everytime you cross my mind (Hey hey hey)
Feeling like I lost mind
Everytime you cross my mind (Hey hey hey)


Feeling like I lost mind
Everytime you cross my mind (You lost my mind)
Feeling like I lost mind
Everytime you cross my mind


Sometimes I think, sometimes I think, this
Sometimes I think, sometimes I think, this
Sometimes I think, sometimes I think, this
Sometimes I think, sometimes I think, this (Hey hey hey)
