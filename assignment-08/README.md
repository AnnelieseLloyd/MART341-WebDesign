1. There are a few differences between divs, classes, ids and spans. For one, divs is used for block-level organization, where a span is for inline organization. Also, an id selector is unique to the page and can only be applied to one element. Where as a class selector can be applied to multiple elements.
2. Some advantages to using a service-hosted videos for your webpage is 1) most of the time it is free 2) It is easy to embed videos 3) Gives you additional exposure to your video. Some disadvantages is 1) Loss of control of your video. When using service-hosted videos, you are relying on a third-party, which isn't always the best case. 2)You lose privacy and control for others downloading your video.
3. Some challenges I had this week were with embedding audio. The embedding part was easy but I wasn't sure if I needed to add the <audio> tag or not. Overall, I figured not because it isn't using <audio> rather it is using <iframe>. Also, my markdown preview was not correctly showing my audio control, so I was worried it wasn't working. However, I pushed it to Github and went onto my website and it looked great.
